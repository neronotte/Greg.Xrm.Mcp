Clean the form of table {tablename} by applying the following rules:

- If the form contains any tab without an unique name (`name` attribute of the `tab` xml element), generate one called `tab_$name`, where $name is the label of the tab, all lowercase, without spaces or special characters.
- If the form contains any section without an unique name (`name` attribute of the `section` xml element), generate one called `$tabname_sec_$name`, where $tabname is the unique name of the tab that contains the section, and $name is the label of the tab, all lowercase, without spaces or special characters.
- Ensure that all `name` attributes of `tab` and `section` elements are unique.
- Remove the `ownerid` field from the first section of the first tab, if present.
- If not present, add another tab called `Administration`, with a two column section called `Administration`.
- Prepend the label of the `Administration` tab with the gear emoji.
- - Hide the label of the `Administration` section of the `Administration` tab  
- In the `Administration` section of the `Administration` tab, add the following columns:
  - `createdby` (first row, first column)
  - `createdon` (first row, second column)
  - `modifiedby` (second row, first column)
  - `modifiedon` (second row, second column)
  - `ownerid` (third row, first column)
